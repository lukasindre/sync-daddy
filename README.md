# Sync Daddy

This thing syncs songs at a best effort attempt from one music provider to another.  Right now, I only built the highway from Spotify to Apple Music.  With that being said, there are some spots that are built to extend the functionality to support multiple destination and source types, though there are other spots that are implemented in a very naive fashion.  Spare my feelings.
